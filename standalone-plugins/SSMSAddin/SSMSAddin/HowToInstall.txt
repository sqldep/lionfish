This sample is brought to you by developers of

SSMSBoost add-in for SSMS (2008, 2008R2, 2012)

SSMSBoost adds quick source code navigation, connection management and much more !
------------------------------------------------------
To compile the project you will need to update the reference to SqlPackageBase.dll
it is installed along with SQL Server Management Studio and is located under following path:
%PROGRAMFILES%\Microsoft SQL Server\110\Tools\Binn\ManagementStudio\SqlPackageBase.dll
(C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\110\Tools\Binn\ManagementStudio\SqlPackageBase.dll)

After you have compiled the sample code you have to let SSMS 2012 know that you want it to load your add-in.
SSMSAddin.addin file provides information about location of compiled add-in dll. So check it and update path 
mentioned by <Assembly> element to location where newly created dll resides (probably bin\debug folder)

Next step - you have to put SSMSAddin.addin to one of "known" folders, where SSMS looks for .addin files. These
folders are listed under this registry key:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\SQL Server Management Studio\11.0_Config\AutomationOptions\LookInFolders

For example:
- Putting SSMSAddin.addin into %PROGRAMDATA%\Application Data\Microsoft\MSEnvShared\Addins\ 
  (C:\ProgramData\Application Data\Microsoft\MSEnvShared\Addins\)
  Will install add-in for all users on the machine.

- Putting SSMSAddin.addin into %APPDATA%\Microsoft\MSEnvShared\Addins\ 
  (C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\MSEnvShared\Addins\) 
  will install for specific user only. 
  
Pay attention that MSEnvShared\Addins\ folder might not exist and you will have to create it yourself.
